Weather use case

• High secure-no third-party IoT devices transactional record-keeping in the decentralized
systems

• A call request to IoT to read weather data is considered a transaction. So, maintaining IoT device transaction
records in decentralized systems is a problem many developers and researchers are working on. It has
recently become popular to do this task with the help of many third-party systems like Google and Amazon.
However, some users do not trust these systems, and they said we want a decentralized system entirely
open for all users and devices to join and without intermediary systems (no third party). • Problem: Please design a transaction-keeping application for IoT devices that can keep the IoT transactional
weather information like (IoT device id, City name, temperature, and timestamp,...) secure and immutable
without using centralized parties and Cloud technology.
